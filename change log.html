<div class="entry">
  <h2>September 20, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">The ‘Totally Didn’t Rebuild the Homepage at 3AM’ Edition</div>

  <p>Greetings, curious scrollers, loyal visitors, and accidental tourists of my corner of the internet,</p>

  <p>Yes, I missed last week’s update. Why? Because illness decided to roll a natural 20 and take me out like an under-leveled NPC. But fear not — I did what any reasonable person would do while mildly feverish and surrounded by tissues: I redesigned the homepage. Naturally.</p>

  <p>✨ Homepage Reborn (Again) :<br>
  Like a phoenix rising from CSS ash, the homepage has been restructured, reshuffled, and resparkled. Projects have claimed their rightful throne at the top (they demanded better visibility, and honestly, they weren’t wrong).</p>

  <p>The Reading, Science, Programming, and History sections were lovingly scooped up and tucked into a brand-new “About Me” section, because apparently that’s where they belong now. The vibe? Cozy chaos with educational overtones.</p>

  <p>Welcome Message #3:<br>
  Yes, I added another welcome message. Why? Because having only two felt weird. You’d scroll down and suddenly — boom, Projects. No hello, no gentle segue, just immediate productivity. Now you get a third welcome. That’s either great UX or the digital equivalent of an overenthusiastic host. Possibly both.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The nav bar went to a spa day. It came back simpler, fresher, and much less emotionally cluttered. It now sips herbal tea and judges your kerning.</li>
    <li>Sections like Reading and Science now have magical “Read More” buttons.</li>
    <li>Clicking them opens new content. Clicking again closes it. Revolutionary? Not exactly. Satisfying? Deeply.</li>
    <li>Only one section expands at a time. Because chaos still needs boundaries.</li>
    <li>The buttons shapeshift between “Read More” and “Show Less” like they’re auditioning for a Marvel movie.</li>
    <li>JavaScript got a little TLC: fixed some rogue variables, found missing braces hiding in the shadows, and refactored some code like I totally knew what I was doing. (I did. Mostly.)</li>
    <li>You can now expand and collapse notes in the Notebook section. Because sometimes you crave knowledge, and other times you crave ✨less✨.</li>
    <li>There’s now a twinkly animated star field in the background.</li>
    <li>It adapts to light/dark mode like a trendy app that’s cooler than both of us.</li>
    <li>It resizes itself politely when the window changes — true star behavior.</li>
    <li>You are literally browsing under a galaxy. You’re welcome.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>⌨️ Typing Effect in the Header (For Drama):<br>
  The header now types out “Exploring science, code, stars, and stories.” Slowly. Cinematically. Like it’s narrating its own coming-of-age montage.</p>

  <p>📱 Mobile Got Love Too:<br>
  Font sizes adapt. Layouts flex. The nav bar now stacks like it’s practicing responsive yoga. Your tiny screen has never been so spoiled.</p>

  <p>📜 Change Logs with Toggle Powers:<br>
  The older logs now live behind expandable menus. Only the latest three are visible by default, because mystery is half the magic (and clutter is the other half, which we’re trying to avoid).</p>

  <p>Repo Cleanliness Initiative:<br>
  The Mad Libs files now have their own folder, complete with digital throw pillows and metaphorical fairy lights. The main repo is cleaner, happier, and 67% less chaotic.</p>

  <p>And so, dear visitor, we reach the end of another thrilling episode in the ongoing saga of “Why Did I Do This at 3AM?”</p>

  <p>May your scrolls be smooth, your buttons clickable, and your console errors few (or at least mildly amusing). I shall now return to my natural habitat: hunched over a keyboard, whispering at CSS like it owes me rent, and telling myself I’ll go to bed “after just one more tweak.” (Narrator: they did not.)</p>

  <p>As always, updates will continue until morale improves — or until JavaScript throws another inexplicable tantrum. Whichever comes first.</p>

  <p>With a keyboard in one hand and a half-finished cup of tea in the other,<br>
  Your Resident Dev, Digital Tinkerer, and Professional Avoider of Proper Sleep Schedules</p>

  <h2>September 6, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">The Homework Strikes Back Edition</div>
  
  <p> Dearest Users, Loyal Madlibbers, and Unwitting Victims of My Creative Whims,<br/>
    Gather 'round the glowing screen, for I bring tidings of mediocre progress wrapped in glorious verbosity. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <strong>✨ NEW: Madlib Mayhem Multiplied!</strong><br/>
  Behold! As of this release, <strong>9</strong> (yes, NINE) freshly baked Madlibs have been delicately hand-crafted, 
      sprinkled with absurdity, and slapped onto the Madlib Page for your reading, laughing, and possible eye-rolling pleasure.<br/>
      Whether you chuckle, chortle, or merely exhale through your nose – your reaction is yours to give. I only provide the word <strong>chaos</strong>. </li>

    <li> <strong>🧠 Known Bugs (AKA Real Life)</strong><br/>
      A certain pesky entity known as "Homework" has decided to respawn more aggressively than anticipated.<br/>
      Despite what one might assume would be a lighter week due to Labor Day (ah, such optimism), the academic overlords decided to double down.<br/>
      Thank you, educators, for ensuring I remain shackled to Google Docs instead of conquering creative glory. Your dedication to my suffering has not gone unnoticed. </li>

    <li> <strong>🧭 Progress Tracker</strong><br/>
      The sacred quest for <strong>30 Madlibs</strong> continues, and lo! We've now reached <strong>15</strong>, which, according to ancient math, is exactly halfway.<br/>
      That’s right — we’ve climbed to the summit of Mount Midway, planted a flag made of nonsense, and are now gazing heroically into the distance... while wheezing from the effort.<br/>
      It’s not “living on a prayer,” it’s more like “barely functioning on snacks and deadlines.” </li>

    <li> <strong>🚀 Onward to New Things</strong><br/>
      In light of this milestone, I shall now pivot (yes, like Ross with the couch) to dabble in new digital mischief.<br/>
      Expect different things. Strange things. Possibly exciting things.<br/>
      <strong>⚠️ Disclaimer:</strong> No release dates promised. Time is a cruel, elusive beast that keeps eating my planner. </li>

    <li> <strong> Final Notes</strong><br/>
      I still have homework to do (please send caffeine and moral support).<br/>
      It's only Month 2 of school and I’m already dreaming of summer.<br/>
      Stay tuned, stay weird, and remember: Madlibs don’t write themselves (but if they did, I’d be free...).<br/><br/>
      Until next time,<br/>
      <em>Your Suffering Yet Determined Developer</em></li>
  </ul>

<h2>September 1, 2025</h2>
<div class="date">Fresh Code, Questionable Sanity</div>
<p>Ah, September. A fresh chapter in the book nobody asked for, but here we are anyway. August finally packed its bags and left — slowly, painfully, like a guest who doesn’t know how to say goodbye. But rejoice! A new era begins.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>🔧 Bug-Free-ish Month</strong><br>
    For the first time in what feels like centuries, I have <em>not</em> been knee-deep in bug hunting. It's both suspicious and beautiful. Am I grateful? Immensely. Will this peace last? Absolutely not.</li>

  <li><strong>🌟 Project Expansion Begins</strong><br>
    I’ve begun adding <em>yet another</em> one of my delightful side projects to the site. Is it finished? Of course not. Will it ever be? Please refer to the previous answer. But it’s there — raw, chaotic, and begging for your attention.</li>

  <li><strong>✍️ Mad Libs Madness</strong><br>
    Welcome to the whimsical world of Mad Libs! I’ve uploaded 6 (yes, SIX) of them so far, with more to come whenever inspiration slaps me across the face. They're funny, unpredictable, and mildly concerning. You're welcome.</li>

  <li><strong>🚀 NASA Image Feed: Jury-Rigged Edition</strong><br>
    Because school is the natural enemy of free time, I haven’t set up my own server for the NASA daily image feed yet. BUT! I’ve cunningly used the demo API key instead. It’s limited to 50 requests per hour — which, let’s be honest, is more than enough for my current visitor count (hi, myself from the future).</li>

  <li><strong>📉 Site Traffic Update</strong><br>
    Still no viral fame. Still no sponsorship deals. But you, dear visitor, are the real MVP. If you’re reading this, you’re part of an exclusive club of “people who found this corner of the internet.”</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all for now — probably for the rest of the week, unless something explodes or I drink too much caffeine and rewrite the entire site at 3 AM. We shall see.</p>

  <h2>August 30, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">Mobile and Theme Overhaul Edition</div>
    <details class="entry-details">
    <summary>🔥 Progress Report or Fire Log?</summary>
<p>Behold, mortals and fellow code warriors! The tyranny of tiny screens and clumsy taps has been vanquished. After much toil and the sacred rites of debugging, the realm of mobile browsing hath been cleansed and refined:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Farewell, Toggle Mode Button! Your flickering reign is over — the wise oracle known as prefers-color-scheme now governs light and dark mode with effortless majesty.</li>
  <li> Color Palette Sorcery: Alchemized colors that transform seamlessly between realms of light and darkness, ensuring your eyeballs receive the royal treatment at all hours.</li>
  <li> Epic CSS Purge: Vanquished redundant code with the ruthless precision of a laser sword. Duplicates? Obliterated. Rules combined? Like a symphony conductor uniting the orchestra. Cleanup = 🎉 mic drop</li>
</ul>
    <p>Phone Users, Rejoice! Your suffering is no more:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Boosted readability with friendlier font sizes and line spacing-no more squinting!</li>
      <li>Made every button and link touch-ready for your majestic thumbs, no more accidental finger fumbles.</li>
      <li>Cleaned and polished the layout till it sparkled brighter than a supernova.</li>
      <li>Responsive design now so smooth it practically moonwalks across your screen.</li>
      <li>Scroll Smoothness Unleashed: Enabled scroll-behavior: smooth for navigation that flows like the silk robes of an intergalactic emperor. Glide effortlessly from section to section, like a comet streaking through the night sky.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Go forth, mobile wanderers, and browse freely in this newly blessed digital kingdom! Your patience hath earned you a glorious reward. </p>
<ul><li>Still not done yet!</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Added a fully responsive navbar and sections—flexing on every screen size</li>
  <li> Navbar Glow-Up of the Century: Introduced a subtle shadow and buttery transitions on scroll — because your navbar deserves to shine like the crown jewel of UX excellence. Subtle? Yes. Powerful? Absolutely.</li>
  <li>Stars now adapt to light and dark mode — no more light pollution!</li>
  <li>Star color now follows system theme with CSS variables + JS = ✨ dynamic stardust</li>
</ul>
    <p> And now, the final twist in this epic saga...</p> <p>For eons (or at least a few commits), I chased shadows in search of the elusive light/dark mode bug. I tweaked colors, double-checked CSS, and questioned reality itself. But as it turns out, I didn’t have a light/dark mode problem-I just <strong>hardcoded the universe to be night forever</strong>.</p> <p>Classic case of <em>“the stars were the problem all along.”</em> </p> <p>The canvas that rendered eternal darkness-the very space-time fabric of this site-had been quietly declaring, “All must be night!” from behind a <code>background: black;</code> decree. No matter how noble the color variables, no matter how pure the system preferences, they were powerless against the iron grip of absolute blackness.</p> <p>But lo! That cursed decree has now been overthrown. The stars have been liberated, the darkness lifted. Whether your browser prefers the sunlit realms of light mode or the tranquil depths of night, the cosmos now answers with matching stardust.</p> <p>This is no mere fix. This is a restoration of balance to the universe. Yin and yang. Light and shadow. CSS and JavaScript. All in harmony once more.</p> <p>So rest easy, traveler. Whether you browse beneath the glow of the sun or by the light of a lonely moon, the stars shall now guide you... appropriately.</p> <p><strong>Dark mode bug: defeated. Cosmic order: restored. We move.</strong> 🚀</p>

  <div class="date">One Log to Rule Them All</div>
    <details class="entry-details">
      <summary>Milestone Achieved… Sort Of</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Just a heads-up:</strong> If I add more changes on the same day, I’ll timestamp them — so when future me reads this, I’ll know I wasn’t just imagining things.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Changelog Format Decision:</strong>  
      Thought about creating a separate changelog for each game or webpage. <br> 
      Then I remembered: I have better things to do. Everything stays in this one log. <br> 
      I’ll at least mention which project each fix belongs to. Generous, I know.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bug: Light/Dark Mode Toggle  
      <br><strong>Where:</strong> You know the page — the one with the brilliant idea that backfired.  
      <br><strong>Issue:</strong> That pesky toggle is still misbehaving.  
      I had a feeling this feature would haunt me, and here we are.  
      It’s giving CSS chaos with a dash of regret.
    </li>

    <li>
      Next Steps: <br> 
      Got a few ideas that might <em>actually</em> fix it this time. <br> 
      Whether it works or turns into another future bug report... we’ll see. Hope lives on.
    </li>

    <li>
      Closing Thought:<br>  
      If you're reading this in the future and the toggle is still cursed... well, at least you saw it coming.
