  <div class="entry">
<h2>September 1, 2025</h2>
<div class="date">Fresh Code, Questionable Sanity</div>
<p>Ah, September. A fresh chapter in the book nobody asked for, but here we are anyway. August finally packed its bags and left ‚Äî slowly, painfully, like a guest who doesn‚Äôt know how to say goodbye. But rejoice! A new era begins.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>üîß Bug-Free-ish Month</strong><br>
    For the first time in what feels like centuries, I have <em>not</em> been knee-deep in bug hunting. It's both suspicious and beautiful. Am I grateful? Immensely. Will this peace last? Absolutely not.</li>

  <li><strong>üåü Project Expansion Begins</strong><br>
    I‚Äôve begun adding <em>yet another</em> one of my delightful side projects to the site. Is it finished? Of course not. Will it ever be? Please refer to the previous answer. But it‚Äôs there ‚Äî raw, chaotic, and begging for your attention.</li>

  <li><strong>‚úçÔ∏è Mad Libs Madness</strong><br>
    Welcome to the whimsical world of Mad Libs! I‚Äôve uploaded 6 (yes, SIX) of them so far, with more to come whenever inspiration slaps me across the face. They're funny, unpredictable, and mildly concerning. You're welcome.</li>

  <li><strong>üöÄ NASA Image Feed: Jury-Rigged Edition</strong><br>
    Because school is the natural enemy of free time, I haven‚Äôt set up my own server for the NASA daily image feed yet. BUT! I‚Äôve cunningly used the demo API key instead. It‚Äôs limited to 50 requests per hour ‚Äî which, let‚Äôs be honest, is more than enough for my current visitor count (hi, myself from the future).</li>

  <li><strong>üìâ Site Traffic Update</strong><br>
    Still no viral fame. Still no sponsorship deals. But you, dear visitor, are the real MVP. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre part of an exclusive club of ‚Äúpeople who found this corner of the internet.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>That‚Äôs all for now ‚Äî probably for the rest of the week, unless something explodes or I drink too much caffeine and rewrite the entire site at 3 AM. We shall see.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
  <h2>August 30, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">Mobile and Theme Overhaul Edition</div>
<p>Behold, mortals and fellow code warriors! The tyranny of tiny screens and clumsy taps has been vanquished. After much toil and the sacred rites of debugging, the realm of mobile browsing hath been cleansed and refined:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Farewell, Toggle Mode Button! Your flickering reign is over ‚Äî the wise oracle known as prefers-color-scheme now governs light and dark mode with effortless majesty.</li>
  <li> Color Palette Sorcery: Alchemized colors that transform seamlessly between realms of light and darkness, ensuring your eyeballs receive the royal treatment at all hours.</li>
  <li> Epic CSS Purge: Vanquished redundant code with the ruthless precision of a laser sword. Duplicates? Obliterated. Rules combined? Like a symphony conductor uniting the orchestra. Cleanup = üéâ mic drop</li>
</ul>
    <p>Phone Users, Rejoice! Your suffering is no more:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Boosted readability with friendlier font sizes and line spacing-no more squinting!</li>
      <li>Made every button and link touch-ready for your majestic thumbs, no more accidental finger fumbles.</li>
      <li>Cleaned and polished the layout till it sparkled brighter than a supernova.</li>
      <li>Responsive design now so smooth it practically moonwalks across your screen.</li>
      <li>Scroll Smoothness Unleashed: Enabled scroll-behavior: smooth for navigation that flows like the silk robes of an intergalactic emperor. Glide effortlessly from section to section, like a comet streaking through the night sky.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Go forth, mobile wanderers, and browse freely in this newly blessed digital kingdom! Your patience hath earned you a glorious reward. </p>
<ul><li>Still not done yet!</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Added a fully responsive navbar and sections‚Äîflexing on every screen size</li>
  <li> Navbar Glow-Up of the Century: Introduced a subtle shadow and buttery transitions on scroll ‚Äî because your navbar deserves to shine like the crown jewel of UX excellence. Subtle? Yes. Powerful? Absolutely.</li>
  <li>Stars now adapt to light and dark mode ‚Äî no more light pollution!</li>
  <li>Star color now follows system theme with CSS variables + JS = ‚ú® dynamic stardust</li>
</ul>
    <p> And now, the final twist in this epic saga...</p> <p>For eons (or at least a few commits), I chased shadows in search of the elusive light/dark mode bug. I tweaked colors, double-checked CSS, and questioned reality itself. But as it turns out, I didn‚Äôt have a light/dark mode problem-I just <strong>hardcoded the universe to be night forever</strong>.</p> <p>Classic case of <em>‚Äúthe stars were the problem all along.‚Äù</em> </p> <p>The canvas that rendered eternal darkness-the very space-time fabric of this site-had been quietly declaring, ‚ÄúAll must be night!‚Äù from behind a <code>background: black;</code> decree. No matter how noble the color variables, no matter how pure the system preferences, they were powerless against the iron grip of absolute blackness.</p> <p>But lo! That cursed decree has now been overthrown. The stars have been liberated, the darkness lifted. Whether your browser prefers the sunlit realms of light mode or the tranquil depths of night, the cosmos now answers with matching stardust.</p> <p>This is no mere fix. This is a restoration of balance to the universe. Yin and yang. Light and shadow. CSS and JavaScript. All in harmony once more.</p> <p>So rest easy, traveler. Whether you browse beneath the glow of the sun or by the light of a lonely moon, the stars shall now guide you... appropriately.</p> <p><strong>Dark mode bug: defeated. Cosmic order: restored. We move.</strong> üöÄ</p>

  <h2>August 24, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">One Log to Rule Them All</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Just a heads-up:</strong> If I add more changes on the same day, I‚Äôll timestamp them ‚Äî so when future me reads this, I‚Äôll know I wasn‚Äôt just imagining things.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Changelog Format Decision:</strong>  
      Thought about creating a separate changelog for each game or webpage. <br> 
      Then I remembered: I have better things to do. Everything stays in this one log. <br> 
      I‚Äôll at least mention which project each fix belongs to. Generous, I know.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bug: Light/Dark Mode Toggle  
      <br><strong>Where:</strong> You know the page ‚Äî the one with the brilliant idea that backfired.  
      <br><strong>Issue:</strong> That pesky toggle is still misbehaving.  
      I had a feeling this feature would haunt me, and here we are.  
      It‚Äôs giving CSS chaos with a dash of regret.
    </li>

    <li>
      Next Steps: <br> 
      Got a few ideas that might <em>actually</em> fix it this time. <br> 
      Whether it works or turns into another future bug report... we‚Äôll see. Hope lives on.
    </li>

    <li>
      Closing Thought:<br>  
      If you're reading this in the future and the toggle is still cursed... well, at least you saw it coming.
    </li>
  </ul>

      <li>Added a navbar because scrolling to the bottom was getting annoying ‚Äî welcome to the future.</li>
      <li>Broke light/dark mode again, fixed it again (yay me).</li>
      <li>Added NASA‚Äôs Image of the Day, but it‚Äôs busted because I still need to figure out how to hide my precious API key behind a backend.</li>
      <li>Not as dumb as you think, thank you very much.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">

    <ul>
      <li>Wrapped up answers to the last two questions.</li>

    </ul>

  <div class="entry">
    <h2>August 7, 2025</h2>
    <div class="date">Back to school blues</div>
    <ul>
      <li>School started, laptop MIA, so no new cool stuff here.</li>
      <li>But hey, I did answer that galaxy simulation question in the notebook. Go look if you‚Äôre curious.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <h2>July 26, 2025</h2>
    <div class="date">Bug hunt in the wild</div>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <h2>July 24, 2025</h2>
    <div class="date">Questions that keep me awake</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Jotted down some brain-busters in the notebook, like:
        <ul>
          <li>Could I simulate a galaxy using just Python and some basic physics?</li>
          <li>What if a spacecraft could plan its own mission ‚Äî without me babysitting it?</li>
          <li>How would a programming language built <em>just</em> for space missions even look?</li>
          <li>Can I fake a black hole‚Äôs gravity with 2D code and some math?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Spoiler alert: I don‚Äôt have the answers here. You gotta wait.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <div class="date">Light vs Dark ‚Äî The Eternal Struggle</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Added light and dark mode support because staring at bright screens at midnight is basically self-torture.</li>

  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <h2>July 16, 2025</h2>
    <div class="date">Getting organized (sort of)</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Threw together a list of my projects. Because chaos is fun but deadlines aren‚Äôt.</li>
      <li>So now there‚Äôs at least some semblance of order. Barely.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <h2>July 15, 2025</h2>
    <div class="date">The birth of brilliance</div>
    <ul>
      <li>I decided to grace the internet with this site. Yep, it‚Äôs live.</li>
      <li>Also dumped in some of my favorite things ‚Äî fun facts, history nuggets, random science tidbits, and the sacred art of programming.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <footer>
    Future plans:<br> Add a JavaScript array to serve up random fun facts daily (because why not).  <br>
    Set up that elusive backend server for NASA‚Äôs image. <br> 
    Maybe get new ideas once I‚Äôm not drowning in homework.  
    <br><br>
    Stay tuned. Or don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not your boss.
