        <h2>Your Mad Lib Story:</h2>
        <p>Yesterday, I had an interview for a job as a <strong>${occupation}</strong>. I arrived ten minutes early, dressed in my best outfit, only to be greeted at the front desk by a <strong>${noun1}</strong>—not a receptionist, an actual <strong>${noun1}</strong> with a nametag and everything.</p>

        <p>Trying to stay professional, I followed the <strong>${noun1}</strong> into a waiting room filled with <strong>${adjective1}</strong> artwork and music that sounded like someone trying to play jazz with a nose flute. Just as I sat down, a loud <strong>${sound}</strong> echoed through the building, and a <strong>${animal}</strong> bolted out of a side door, knocking over a potted plant and nearly tripping me.</p>

        <p>The interviewer finally arrived, completely unfazed by the chaos. He wore a suit made of what looked like recycled <strong>${object}</strong>s and offered me a seat on a wobbly chair that squeaked every time I moved. We started the interview with some basic questions, but then he asked, "If you had to <strong>${verbPast}</strong> during a team-building exercise, how would you explain it to upper management?" I laughed nervously, unsure whether he was joking.</p>

        <p>Then things got even more <strong>${adjective2}</strong>. The lights dimmed, a disco ball lowered from the ceiling, and the <strong>${animal}</strong> returned—this time wearing a tiny tie and sunglasses. “Don’t mind Gerald,” the interviewer said. “He leads our mindfulness sessions.”</p>

        <p>By the time I left, I wasn’t sure if I had just interviewed for a job, attended a performance art piece, or unknowingly joined a secret society. One thing’s for sure: it was the most bizarre, unforgettable job interview of my life.</p>
