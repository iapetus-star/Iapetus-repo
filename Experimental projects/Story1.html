    <div class="text-story" id="textStory">
      <p>In a crooked tower on the edge of a cliff no one could pronounce, lived a wizard named Thindlebum the Moist. He wasn’t called that because of his magical prowess (which was questionable), but rather because his tower had terrible plumbing. Every time he conjured a cup of tea, a pipe would burst somewhere else.</p>
      <p>On the 47th Tuesday of the month, because wizards don’t follow regular calendars, Thindlebum decided it was time to finally fix the one room of his tower he feared most: the bathroom.</p>
      <p>“This chamber of horrors has mocked me long enough,” he declared, staff in one hand, a plumber's wrench in the other. “Today, I shall cast the Flush Eternal spell!”</p>
      <p>He had invented it himself, using equal parts ancient grimoires, a cursed scroll he found in a cereal box, and the back label of a bottle of enchanted bleach. According to Thindlebum, the Flush Eternal would permanently cleanse the toilet of all foulness, banishing blockage and odor into the Void of Cleanliness.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, he had misread one vital rune, which he thought said “purify,” but actually translated to “summon interdimensional sewage abomination.”</p>
      <p>No sooner had he waved his wand and uttered the sacred words- “Sani-tarium Excretus Totalus!”- the porcelain throne began to rumble.</p>
      <p>First, a trickle of green slime oozed from the bowl.</p>
      <p>Then came the tentacle.</p>
      <p>And then, the eyes.</p>
      <p>“By the sacred loofah of Lumbarax!” Thindlebum cried, tripping over a stack of enchanted bidet schematics as the toilet erupted into a shrieking, gurgling horror with twelve dripping arms, a gaping vortex for a mouth, and a suspiciously minty smell.</p>
      <p>The creature roared in a language that sounded like someone gargling a wet trumpet.</p>
      <p>“NOPE,” said Thindlebum, and fled the bathroom, slamming the door which promptly exploded.</p>
      <p>The mutant toilet beast, now fully free, slithered out of the tower and down the cliffside, leaving a trail of steaming soap suds and slightly cleaner grass in its wake.</p>
      <p>Within the hour, it had reached the local village of Crustlebog.</p>
      <p>Within the second hour, it had consumed the mayor, four cows, and the entire plumbing department, absorbing their knowledge and forming a hive-mind of highly intelligent toilet sludge.</p>
      <p>By sundown, it had declared itself Supreme Overlord of Sanitation, enforced with an army of reanimated bidets and hostile loofahs.</p>
      <p>Thindlebum, watching all this from his broken tower with a bowl of popcorn and a minor concussion, realized he had made a small magical error. “Perhaps a bit too much Void Essence,” he muttered.</p>
      <p>Desperate to fix the mess, he consulted the only other wizard stupid enough to help: Doug the Somewhat Adequate, a sorcerer who lived in a giant boot and once accidentally summoned a swarm of talking pineapples.</p>
      <p>Together, they hatched a plan.</p>
      <p>Using a combination of magical drain cleaner, a kazoo made of moonstone, and a giant plunger forged in the fires of Mount Flushmore, they created the Suction of Doom.</p>
      <p>At sunrise, the final battle began.</p>
      <p>Villagers watched in awe and mild nausea as Thindlebum and Doug rode into the fray on flying bathtubs, flinging enchanted soap bombs at the tentacled menace.</p>
      <p>The Toilet Beast roared, flinging pipes and toilets like missiles. One exploded into confetti for no reason.</p>
      <p>“NOW, DOUG!” Thindlebum shouted.</p>
      <p>Doug tripped, dropped the kazoo, and accidentally triggered the spell early. The Suction of Doom activated: backwards.</p>
      <p>For thirty seconds, all of Crustlebog was pulled into a swirling vortex of magical plumbing chaos. When the dust settled, the monster was gone… but so was every single toilet in a five-mile radius.</p>
      <p>The villagers, stunned and slightly constipated, slowly turned to Thindlebum.</p>
      <p>“Uh,” he said, “good news! You’re safe. Bad news… you’re going to need very big buckets.”</p>
      <p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
      <p>Thindlebum was banished from Crustlebog. Again. He returned to his tower and built an outhouse. No magic. Just wood, nails, and quiet shame.</p>
      <p>The mutant toilet, however… was not destroyed. It now sleeps beneath the earth, dreaming foul dreams of vengeance and bleach.</p>
      <p>Beware your next flush.</p>
