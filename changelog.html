  <h1>Iapetus Project Changelog 🧠✨</h1>

<div class="entry">
  <h2>October 11, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">The Week I Was Supposed to Rest: A Tragedy in Commits</div>

  
<p>Another week gone...</p>
<p>School gave me a week off. A whole, beautiful week to relax. To chill. To not spend three hours every night buried in homework like some kind of academic cryptid.</p>
<p>I claimed I’d use the time to rest. I promised I’d take it easy.</p>
<p>Instead, I blinked, and suddenly I’m 27 commits deep, debugging ghost files, and redesigning my 404 page like it’s a personality quiz that judges your soul.</p>
<p>Not only did I not rest, I went full gremlin-mode on this project.</p>
<p>You may want to grab a snack or a neck pillow, this changelog is longer than the time it took me to debug that one rogue comma (more on that later).</p>
<p>You’ve been warned. You’ve been worned. You’ve been aggressively forewarnicated.</p>
<p>Let’s go:</p>
<p>📜 Licensing Things Like a Real Developer™</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a LICENSE to the repo that says: "please don't steal my stuff unless you're cool about it."</li>
  <li>This applies to both the repo and the website, meaning everything now comes with legally binding vibes.</li>
</ul>

<p>⬆️ Back to Top Button, But With Flair</p>
<ul>
  <li>Now has an icon. That’s it. Icon = Instant Professionalism™.</li>
</ul>

<p>🧭 The 404 Page: Now With 400% More Sass</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added an input with placeholder: "I was looking for..."</li>
  <li>Added a "Confess" button because you clearly did something wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>🖌️ Styled Like It's 2009 Tumblr</p>
<ul>
  <li>Styled inputs and buttons with margins, padding, border-radius, and hover effects.</li>
  <li>Added a <code>.response</code> div that talks back to the user.</li>
  <li>Styled it with italics, a green "we're not mad, just disappointed" vibe, and a sensible max-width.</li>
</ul>

<p>🔐 Anchor Tag Security Patch</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added <code>rel="noopener noreferrer"</code> to the "Return to Home" link.</li>
  <li>Translation: "No, hacker man, you may NOT sit with us."</li>
</ul>

<p>🧠 JavaScript Shenanigans</p>
<ul>
  <li>Created an array of 35 sassy, unnecessary response messages.</li>
  <li><code>confess()</code> reads your input and returns a random roast.</li>
  <li>Includes a dramatic "thinking..." pause before typing out the message letter-by-letter.</li>
  <li>Built <code>typeText()</code> for the typing effect. It's a drama queen.</li>
  <li>Final result: The 404 page now roasts, comforts, and confuses you. Simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<p>🎨 Changelog Page: Color Me Impressed</p>
<p>Light Mode Glow-Up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Background: Warm creamy tone (like coffee or denial).</li>
  <li>Text: Slightly less soul-crushing black.</li>
  <li>Entry Background: Pastel beige for chill vibes.</li>
  <li>Entry Borders: Bright oranges that scream “organized chaos.”</li>
  <li>Headers: Muted navy → Indigo with main-character energy.</li>
  <li>Subheaders: Vivid purple-blue. Royalty-core.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dark Mode Got That Moody Aesthetic:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Background: Lightened slightly to avoid full void-stare.</li>
  <li>Text: Brightened (for readability, not judgment).</li>
  <li>Entry Background: Softer — your eyes deserve peace.</li>
  <li>Borders: Pastel orange — spooky but soothing.</li>
  <li>Headers: Warmer yellow.</li>
  <li>Subheaders: Goth lavender.</li>
</ul>

<p>📄 MadLibs Page: Now with Taste™</p>
<p>Visual Glow-Up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Light Mode: Creamy yellow + hot pink = serotonin.</li>
  <li>Dark Mode: Deep purple + warm orange = spooky but friendly.</li>
  <li>Links styled as cards. Hover effects = ✨event✨.</li>
  <li>Comic Neue font. Fun is mandatory.</li>
  <li>Fully responsive — your phone will thank you.</li>
</ul>

<p>HTML/CSS Cleanup:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wrapped everything in a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag. Because semantics.</li>
  <li>No more inline styles. Pure CSS now.</li>
  <li>Max-width and centered layout added. Hello, professionalism.</li>
  <li>Tidied up the footer so it stops silently judging the rest of the layout.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Also: fixed a rogue space in “The Great Adventure.”<br/>
Because chaos has no place here (just kidding, it lives here rent-free).</p>

<p>🛠️ Code That Doesn’t Suck</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduced CSS variables for colors. Reusable, readable, radiant.</li>
  <li>Media queries now handle light/dark themes and font sizes like champs.</li>
  <li>Applied CSS reset so browsers stop acting up.</li>
  <li>Inline CSS is now illegal (in this house).</li>
</ul>

<p>📣 ANNOUNCEMENT BANNER: Now You Know What’s New Whether You Want To or Not</p>
<ul>
  <li>Appears on homepage when there’s a new changelog.</li>
  <li>Uses localStorage to remember if you've seen it.</li>
  <li>Dismissable with a ✖ button. Instant "Yes mom, I saw it."</li>
  <li>Works on mobile. Doesn’t explode. Looks good doing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visual + UX Details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Matches site themes (light/dark).</li>
  <li>Fade-out on dismiss = ✨drama✨.</li>
  <li>Hover transitions + accessibility states included.</li>
  <li><code>role="alert"</code> so screen readers shout it.</li>
</ul>

<p>🧠 The Nerdy Bits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Script safely reads the changelog file. If it’s busted, it gracefully dies without taking down the whole site.</li>
  <li>Includes fallback checks in case localStorage ghosts us.</li>
  <li>It’s smart enough not to show the same banner twice, because you deserve peace.</li>
  <li>All  I need to do is update the changelog, banner updates itself. I have evolved past manual labor.</li>
</ul>

<p>🐞 Bug Fixes: Mistakes Were Made</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed one rogue comma that broke everything.</li>
  <li>Renamed the changelog file. Banner script now recognizes it exists.</li>
  <li>Updated all file references to the new name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Conclusion: Please Let Me Lie Down Now</p>
<p>Wow, I got tired just writing all of that.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know how I had time to do all this, let alone type it out like some caffeinated documentation goblin. Pretty sure I blacked out mid-week and woke up surrounded by commits, half-written CSS, and the faint whisper of “why won’t this work?” echoing through my skull.</p>
<p>This week? Massive.</p>
<p>The next few? Minimal. Whisper-level updates.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
  <li>I need a break before my keyboard files an HR complaint.</li>
  <li>I have school club events that require me to rehearse and be in public. A direct attack on my web goblin lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, things will slow down.</p>
<p>We’re talking “lifting a single paperclip” levels of effort.</p>
<p>But don’t worry. I’ll be back when I miss arguing with JavaScript more than I fear it.</p>
<p>Until then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stay weird,</li>
  <li>Drink water,</li>
  <li>Touch grass (or at least clean your keyboard),</li>
  <li>Avoid semantically incorrect HTML,</li>
  <li>And for the love of all that is front-end… test on mobile.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you end up on the 404 page, that’s on you. But hey, the response box is ready to judge you either way.</p>
<p>Peace ✌️<br>Your tired, possibly feral, still-functioning web developer</p>

  <h2>October 5, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">Patch Notes from the Brink</div>
  <p>Alright, buckle up. Last week’s bug didn’t just crash my code, it crash-landed my will to live. Motivation flatlined, and I somehow became a black-belt in doomscrolling. Pretty sure I unlocked a secret level of the Internet where time stops and productivity goes to die.</p>
  <p>But! I wasn’t about to let the weekend become a total dumpster fire. So between a minor identity crisis and falling down a Wikipedia rabbit hole about octopus intelligence (don’t ask), I did manage to get some stuff done.</p>
  <p>First on the hit list: the projects section. It was looking like a digital junk drawer. Chaotic, unlabeled, and a little sad. So I gave it a full makeover. Now each project has its own fancy heading, a solid description, and some well-deserved dignity. No more lumping everything together like forgotten leftovers. These babies are plated up like Michelin-star dishes. Kind of.</p>
  <p>Next up: the notebook. I added 8 brand-new questions, though don’t get too hyped, because the answers are still MIA. Think of it like an escape room where the clues are just… vibes.</p>
  <p>BUT! I did clean up and expand the answers for the first four questions. Now they’re slightly less “what is happening?” and more “ohhh okay, that tracks.”</p>
  <p>To stop the main page from exploding like a piñata full of spaghetti, I spun up a shiny new Experimentals page. It’s the home for all those quirky side projects. The ones too small to be featured but too weird to be ignored. Dropped in two new projects and stories to get the party started. Expect more chaos soon.</p>
  <p>And in other news:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Added <code>rel="noopener noreferrer"</code> to all links for safety and privacy</li>
  <li>This means:
  <ul>
  <li>Keeps shady pages from poking around the original tab</li>
  <li>Hides referrer info like a ghosted ex</li>
  <li>Basically gives each link a tiny sword and says, “Protect thyself”</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Started updating the links page. Homepage and experimentals are done, more coming soon</li>
  <li>Polished the footer — it no longer gives off “forgotten sock under the bed” energy</li>
  <li>Started a color scheme rebellion, expect some bright new vibes starting with the Experimentals page</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And now, as we close out this episode of “What Was I Thinking?” Here’s the tea: I’ve got the entire week off. That means a flood of updates, spicy experiments, and the kind of late-night code changes that I’ll probably regret by Thursday.</p>
  <p>So stay tuned, keep your browser refreshed, and remember: progress is still progress, even if it’s wearing pajamas and screaming into the void.</p>
  <p>Catch you on the flip side,<br>
Your friendly neighborhood code gremlin & professional bedtime procrastinator</p>

  <h2>September 28, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">The Navbar Nightmare Chronicles</div>

  <p>Dearest Code Warriors, Reluctant Debuggers, and Fellow Sufferers of Unexpected Site Shenanigans,<br/> Prepare yourselves to dive headfirst into a tale of noble intentions, sneaky bugs, and the tragic downfall of a humble navbar.</p>
  <p>Remember a while ago when I added a navbar to my website? I had been neck-deep in web design tutorials for hours. Somewhere between “this’ll be quick” and “why is it 2 a.m.,” I thought, <em>“You know what would make my site pop? A sleek little navbar.”</em></p>
  <p>So I built one. It looked good. It felt good. It worked. At least, for a while.</p>
  <p>Fast-forward a few weeks. I got inspired again and decided to add page animations.</p>
  <p>Did I stop and think about how those animations would interact with the navbar? Of course not. I was in "just one more little feature" mode.</p>
  <p>It was supposed to be simple. Chill. A sprinkle of motion to make the site feel alive. Instead, the universe decided to give me a lesson in humility.</p>
  <p>A few weeks later, I'm sitting at school, casually pulling up my site, ready to bask in my coding glory. I click on the navbar links, expecting to be whisked away to my pages like a boss. Instead, I get a lovely little message that says, <strong>"Moved to line one."</strong></p>
  <p>I stared at the screen. Hard. Like maybe if I stared long enough, it would go away or explain itself. It didn’t. It just sat there, mocking me. Like, "You thought you were in control? Cute."</p>
  <p>Was it a bug? A feature? A CSS demon? A forgotten line of JavaScript from 3 a.m. brain fog? I had no clue. All I knew was that my navbar was cursed, and I was about to spiral.</p>
  <p>Now, I had homework. I had a life. I couldn’t deal with it right then. So I did what every developer tells themselves: <strong>"I’ll fix it on Saturday."</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Friday: False Hope</strong></p>
  <p>I usually start my weekend coding a little early. So Friday after school, I sat down and started poking around.</p>
  <p>Now, I actually had solid plans for Saturday. I wasn’t just going to fix a bug. I wanted to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a new project to the site</li>
    <li>Expand the project list so each one had its own heading</li>
    <li>Write short descriptions for each project</li>
    <li>Add a quick explanation in the "About Me" section because right now it just jumps straight into my info like a Wikipedia article</li>
    <li>Do the same for the Projects section to give some context before throwing links at people</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But no. This bug had other ideas.</p>
  <p>What followed was three straight hours of total failure. What I tried:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scroll-top fixes</li>
    <li>Scroll-top combined with fixed navbar</li>
    <li>Random divs with 200px height before each section</li>
    <li>CSS min-height tweaks</li>
    <li>Even JavaScript that manually calculated and adjusted scroll positions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Absolutely nothing worked.</p>
  <p>At one point, I seriously thought my code was haunted. I stared at it like it had betrayed me. Then I did what any reasonable person would do. I shut the laptop, rage-quit GitHub, and told myself, <strong>"If this isn’t fixed by tomorrow, the navbar is dead."</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Saturday: The Reckoning</strong></p>
  <p>I had real plans. I was supposed to be productive. But instead of working on all the cool features I had lined up, I was back in the trenches, fighting the same stupid bug.</p>
  <p>Three more hours of Googling, testing, breaking things, unbreaking them, only to break them again. Still no fix. Still the same "Moved to line one" nonsense.</p>
  <p>At some point, I realized something important.</p>
  <p>This navbar was not worth it.</p>
  <p>It had officially crossed the line from "fun little feature" to "enemy of the state." So I made a decision.</p>
  <p>I deleted it.</p>
  <p>Gone. Wiped off the face of the repo. Good riddance.</p>
  <p><strong>The Sidebar Era Begins</strong></p>
  <p>I replaced the navbar with a sidebar. And honestly? That move was elite.</p>
  <p>Let me explain why:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>More space. It doesn't cram everything into one thin strip across the top.</li>
    <li>Way better on mobile. No weird collapsing or stretching. Just clean toggles.</li>
    <li>Easier navigation. I could fit more links without making it look like a cluttered mess.</li>
    <li>It looks cooler. Sidebars just have that modern, sleek vibe. Navbars are fine, but they're the vanilla ice cream of layout design.</li>
    <li>More flexible. I can put the sidebar on the left or right. Navbars are stuck at the top like a stubborn ceiling fan.</li>
    <li>Better user experience. People expect sidebars these days. It makes the site feel more intuitive.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>So yeah. I switched. And life was good.</p>
  <p>No regrets.</p>
  <p>Well, almost.</p>
  <p>Because even after switching to the sidebar, the "Moved to line one" message still showed up. I couldn't believe it. I had completely deleted the navbar, and yet the chaos remained.</p>
  <p>At that point, I started thinking maybe my site was cursed.</p>
  <p>But after digging deeper, I finally found the culprit. It had nothing to do with the navbar at all. It was some scroll behavior in the JavaScript that didn’t account for a fixed element at the top of the page. One small script change later, everything worked.</p>
  <p>Could I have saved the navbar?</p>
  <p>Maybe.</p>
  <p>Would I go back and keep it?</p>
  <p>Not a chance.</p>
  <p>It cost me a weekend, hijacked my entire to-do list, and burned through my motivation like it was kindling. But in the end, I still walked away with a working site and a design that feels way better than before.</p>
  <p>The sidebar works. The bug is dead. And I can finally move on.</p>
  <p><strong>What Did I Learn?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Just because something looks good in a tutorial doesn’t mean it’s going to work on your site</li>
    <li>Always test how different features interact, especially animations</li>
    <li>Bugs don’t care about your calendar</li>
    <li>Sometimes you have to scrap the idea, not just patch it</li>
    <li>Bugs will always eat your weekend if you let them</li>
    <li>Writing about your pain makes it slightly more tolerable</li>
    <li>And finally, some bugs are just there to remind you that you're not as in control as you think</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This bug was brutal. I’ve dealt with annoying collapsible menus. I’ve survived layout-breaking CSS. But this one? This one had a personal vendetta.</p>
  <p>Still, the site works now. The sidebar looks better. The bug is gone. And even though I lost a whole weekend, I gained a solid lesson in what not to do.</p>
  <p>Next time, maybe I’ll plan ahead. Or maybe I’ll wing it again and just hope I don’t end up writing another one of these.</p>
  <p>Either way, I’ll be laughing about it by Sunday night. Probably.</p>
  <p>So yeah, the navbar's gone. The bug's gone. My weekend? Also gone.</p> <p>But hey, the site's working, the sidebar actually makes things better, and I can finally stop questioning my life choices—at least when it comes to scroll behavior.</p> <p>Was it annoying? Absolutely. Was it avoidable? Probably. Would I do it all the same way again? …Don’t ask me that right now.</p> <p>For now, I'm just glad it's over. Let the sidebar era begin.</p>

  <h2>September 20, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">The ‘Totally Didn’t Rebuild the Homepage at 3AM’ Edition</div>
      <details class="entry-details">
    <summary>Crafted between coughs and questionable life choices.</summary>

  <p>Greetings, curious scrollers, loyal visitors, and accidental tourists of my corner of the internet,</p>
  <p>Yes, I missed last week’s update. Why? Because illness decided to roll a natural 20 and take me out like an under-leveled NPC. But fear not, I did what any reasonable person would do while mildly feverish and surrounded by tissues: I redesigned the homepage. Naturally.</p>
  <p>✨ Homepage Reborn (Again) :<br>
  Like a phoenix rising from CSS ash, the homepage has been restructured, reshuffled, and resparkled. Projects have claimed their rightful throne at the top (they demanded better visibility, and honestly, they weren’t wrong).</p>
  <p>The Reading, Science, Programming, and History sections were lovingly scooped up and tucked into a brand-new “About Me” section, because apparently that’s where they belong now. The vibe? Cozy chaos with educational overtones.</p>
  <p>Welcome Message #3:<br>
  Yes, I added another welcome message. Why? Because having only two felt weird. You’d scroll down and suddenly boom, Projects. No hello, no gentle segue, just immediate productivity. Now you get a third welcome. That’s either great UX or the digital equivalent of an overenthusiastic host. Possibly both.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The nav bar went to a spa day. It came back simpler, fresher, and much less emotionally cluttered. It now sips herbal tea and judges your kerning.</li>
    <li>Sections like Reading and Science now have magical “Read More” buttons.</li>
    <li>Clicking them opens new content. Clicking again closes it. Revolutionary? Not exactly. Satisfying? Deeply.</li>
    <li>Only one section expands at a time. Because chaos still needs boundaries.</li>
    <li>The buttons shapeshift between “Read More” and “Show Less” like they’re auditioning for a Marvel movie.</li>
    <li>JavaScript got a little TLC: fixed some rogue variables, found missing braces hiding in the shadows, and refactored some code like I totally knew what I was doing. (I did. Mostly.)</li>
    <li>You can now expand and collapse notes in the Notebook section. Because sometimes you crave knowledge, and other times you crave ✨less✨.</li>
    <li>There’s now a twinkly animated star field in the background.</li>
    <li>It adapts to light/dark mode like a trendy app that’s cooler than both of us.</li>
    <li>It resizes itself politely when the window changes — true star behavior.</li>
    <li>You are literally browsing under a galaxy. You’re welcome.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>⌨️ Typing Effect in the Header (For Drama):<br>
  The header now types out “Exploring science, code, stars, and stories.” Slowly. Cinematically. Like it’s narrating its own coming-of-age montage.</p>
  <p>📱 Mobile Got Love Too:<br>
  Font sizes adapt. Layouts flex. The nav bar now stacks like it’s practicing responsive yoga. Your tiny screen has never been so spoiled.</p>
  <p>📜 Change Logs with Toggle Powers:<br>
  The older logs now live behind expandable menus. Only the latest three are visible by default, because mystery is half the magic (and clutter is the other half, which we’re trying to avoid).</p>
  <p>Repo Cleanliness Initiative:<br>
  The Mad Libs files now have their own folder, complete with digital throw pillows and metaphorical fairy lights. The main repo is cleaner, happier, and 67% less chaotic.</p>
  <p>And so, dear visitor, we reach the end of another thrilling episode in the ongoing saga of “Why Did I Do This at 3AM?”</p>
  <p>May your scrolls be smooth, your buttons clickable, and your console errors few (or at least mildly amusing). I shall now return to my natural habitat: hunched over a keyboard, whispering at CSS like it owes me rent, and telling myself I’ll go to bed “after just one more tweak.” (Narrator: they did not.)</p>
  <p>As always, updates will continue until morale improves — or until JavaScript throws another inexplicable tantrum. Whichever comes first.</p>
  <p>With a keyboard in one hand and a half-finished cup of tea in the other,<br>
  Your Resident Dev, Digital Tinkerer, and Professional Avoider of Proper Sleep Schedules</p>

  <div class="date">The Homework Strikes Back Edition</div>
      <details class="entry-details">
    <summary>Minimal progress, maximum effort.</summary>

  <p> Dearest Users, Loyal Madlibbers, and Unwitting Victims of My Creative Whims,<br/>
    Gather 'round the glowing screen, for I bring tidings of mediocre progress wrapped in glorious verbosity. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <strong>✨ NEW: Madlib Mayhem Multiplied!</strong><br/>
  Behold! As of this release, <strong>9</strong> (yes, NINE) freshly baked Madlibs have been delicately hand-crafted, 
      sprinkled with absurdity, and slapped onto the Madlib Page for your reading, laughing, and possible eye-rolling pleasure.<br/>
      Whether you chuckle, chortle, or merely exhale through your nose – your reaction is yours to give. I only provide the word <strong>chaos</strong>. </li>

    <li> <strong>🧠 Known Bugs (AKA Real Life)</strong><br/>
      A certain pesky entity known as "Homework" has decided to respawn more aggressively than anticipated.<br/>
      Despite what one might assume would be a lighter week due to Labor Day (ah, such optimism), the academic overlords decided to double down.<br/>
      Thank you, educators, for ensuring I remain shackled to Google Docs instead of conquering creative glory. Your dedication to my suffering has not gone unnoticed. </li>

    <li> <strong>🧭 Progress Tracker</strong><br/>
      The sacred quest for <strong>30 Madlibs</strong> continues, and lo! We've now reached <strong>15</strong>, which, according to ancient math, is exactly halfway.<br/>
      That’s right — we’ve climbed to the summit of Mount Midway, planted a flag made of nonsense, and are now gazing heroically into the distance... while wheezing from the effort.<br/>
      It’s not “living on a prayer,” it’s more like “barely functioning on snacks and deadlines.” </li>

    <li> <strong>🚀 Onward to New Things</strong><br/>
      In light of this milestone, I shall now pivot (yes, like Ross with the couch) to dabble in new digital mischief.<br/>
      Expect different things. Strange things. Possibly exciting things.<br/>
      <strong>⚠️ Disclaimer:</strong> No release dates promised. Time is a cruel, elusive beast that keeps eating my planner. </li>

    <li> <strong> Final Notes</strong><br/>
      I still have homework to do (please send caffeine and moral support).<br/>
      It's only Month 2 of school and I’m already dreaming of summer.<br/>
      Stay tuned, stay weird, and remember: Madlibs don’t write themselves (but if they did, I’d be free...).<br/><br/>
      Until next time,<br/>
      <em>Your Suffering Yet Determined Developer</em></li>

<h2>September 1, 2025</h2>
<div class="date">Fresh Code, Questionable Sanity</div>
    <details class="entry-details">
    <summary>🚧 Work in Progress, But Released Anyway</summary>
<p>Ah, September. A fresh chapter in the book nobody asked for, but here we are anyway. August finally packed its bags and left — slowly, painfully, like a guest who doesn’t know how to say goodbye. But rejoice! A new era begins.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>🔧 Bug-Free-ish Month</strong><br>
    For the first time in what feels like centuries, I have <em>not</em> been knee-deep in bug hunting. It's both suspicious and beautiful. Am I grateful? Immensely. Will this peace last? Absolutely not.</li>

  <li><strong>🌟 Project Expansion Begins</strong><br>
    I’ve begun adding <em>yet another</em> one of my delightful side projects to the site. Is it finished? Of course not. Will it ever be? Please refer to the previous answer. But it’s there — raw, chaotic, and begging for your attention.</li>

  <li><strong>✍️ Mad Libs Madness</strong><br>
    Welcome to the whimsical world of Mad Libs! I’ve uploaded 6 (yes, SIX) of them so far, with more to come whenever inspiration slaps me across the face. They're funny, unpredictable, and mildly concerning. You're welcome.</li>

  <li><strong>🚀 NASA Image Feed: Jury-Rigged Edition</strong><br>
    Because school is the natural enemy of free time, I haven’t set up my own server for the NASA daily image feed yet. BUT! I’ve cunningly used the demo API key instead. It’s limited to 50 requests per hour — which, let’s be honest, is more than enough for my current visitor count (hi, myself from the future).</li>

  <li><strong>📉 Site Traffic Update</strong><br>
    Still no viral fame. Still no sponsorship deals. But you, dear visitor, are the real MVP. If you’re reading this, you’re part of an exclusive club of “people who found this corner of the internet.”</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all for now — probably for the rest of the week, unless something explodes or I drink too much caffeine and rewrite the entire site at 3 AM. We shall see.</p>

  <div class="date">Mobile and Theme Overhaul Edition</div>
    <details class="entry-details">
    <summary>🔥 Progress Report or Fire Log?</summary>
<p>Behold, mortals and fellow code warriors! The tyranny of tiny screens and clumsy taps has been vanquished. After much toil and the sacred rites of debugging, the realm of mobile browsing hath been cleansed and refined:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Farewell, Toggle Mode Button! Your flickering reign is over — the wise oracle known as prefers-color-scheme now governs light and dark mode with effortless majesty.</li>
  <li> Color Palette Sorcery: Alchemized colors that transform seamlessly between realms of light and darkness, ensuring your eyeballs receive the royal treatment at all hours.</li>
  <li> Epic CSS Purge: Vanquished redundant code with the ruthless precision of a laser sword. Duplicates? Obliterated. Rules combined? Like a symphony conductor uniting the orchestra. Cleanup = 🎉 mic drop</li>
</ul>
    <p>Phone Users, Rejoice! Your suffering is no more:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Boosted readability with friendlier font sizes and line spacing-no more squinting!</li>
      <li>Made every button and link touch-ready for your majestic thumbs, no more accidental finger fumbles.</li>
      <li>Cleaned and polished the layout till it sparkled brighter than a supernova.</li>
      <li>Responsive design now so smooth it practically moonwalks across your screen.</li>
      <li>Scroll Smoothness Unleashed: Enabled scroll-behavior: smooth for navigation that flows like the silk robes of an intergalactic emperor. Glide effortlessly from section to section, like a comet streaking through the night sky.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Go forth, mobile wanderers, and browse freely in this newly blessed digital kingdom! Your patience hath earned you a glorious reward. </p>
<ul><li>Still not done yet!</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Added a fully responsive navbar and sections—flexing on every screen size</li>
  <li> Navbar Glow-Up of the Century: Introduced a subtle shadow and buttery transitions on scroll — because your navbar deserves to shine like the crown jewel of UX excellence. Subtle? Yes. Powerful? Absolutely.</li>
  <li>Stars now adapt to light and dark mode — no more light pollution!</li>
  <li>Star color now follows system theme with CSS variables + JS = ✨ dynamic stardust</li>
</ul>
    <p> And now, the final twist in this epic saga...</p> <p>For eons (or at least a few commits), I chased shadows in search of the elusive light/dark mode bug. I tweaked colors, double-checked CSS, and questioned reality itself. But as it turns out, I didn’t have a light/dark mode problem-I just <strong>hardcoded the universe to be night forever</strong>.</p> <p>Classic case of <em>“the stars were the problem all along.”</em> </p> <p>The canvas that rendered eternal darkness-the very space-time fabric of this site-had been quietly declaring, “All must be night!” from behind a <code>background: black;</code> decree. No matter how noble the color variables, no matter how pure the system preferences, they were powerless against the iron grip of absolute blackness.</p> <p>But lo! That cursed decree has now been overthrown. The stars have been liberated, the darkness lifted. Whether your browser prefers the sunlit realms of light mode or the tranquil depths of night, the cosmos now answers with matching stardust.</p> <p>This is no mere fix. This is a restoration of balance to the universe. Yin and yang. Light and shadow. CSS and JavaScript. All in harmony once more.</p> <p>So rest easy, traveler. Whether you browse beneath the glow of the sun or by the light of a lonely moon, the stars shall now guide you... appropriately.</p> <p><strong>Dark mode bug: defeated. Cosmic order: restored. We move.</strong> 🚀</p>

  <h2>August 24, 2025</h2>
  <div class="date">One Log to Rule Them All</div>
    <details class="entry-details">
      <summary>Milestone Achieved… Sort Of</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Just a heads-up:</strong> If I add more changes on the same day, I’ll timestamp them — so when future me reads this, I’ll know I wasn’t just imagining things.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Changelog Format Decision:</strong>  
      Thought about creating a separate changelog for each game or webpage. <br> 
      Then I remembered: I have better things to do. Everything stays in this one log. <br> 
      I’ll at least mention which project each fix belongs to. Generous, I know.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bug: Light/Dark Mode Toggle  
      <br><strong>Where:</strong> You know the page — the one with the brilliant idea that backfired.  
      <br><strong>Issue:</strong> That pesky toggle is still misbehaving.  
      I had a feeling this feature would haunt me, and here we are.  
      It’s giving CSS chaos with a dash of regret.
    </li>

    <li>
      Next Steps: <br> 
      Got a few ideas that might <em>actually</em> fix it this time. <br> 
      Whether it works or turns into another future bug report... we’ll see. Hope lives on.
    </li>

    <li>
      Closing Thought:<br>  
      If you're reading this in the future and the toggle is still cursed... well, at least you saw it coming.
